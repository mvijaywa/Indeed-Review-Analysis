# Indeed-Review-Analysis
Analyzing the text data apart from the numerical data is very helpful in understand why a person has given a rating of one or five.
Indeed.com provides company review/ratings that could be used to understand the sentiment associated with employees.
This project is divided into five steps: a) Scraping the reviews from the website b) Cleaning the data and performing EDA on the data c) Extracating the sentiment d)LDA topic modeling to identify the aspects in the data set and e)classifying the reviews using Naive Bayes.
